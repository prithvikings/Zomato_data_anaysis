# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing Zomato data to understand various aspects of restaurant performance and customer preferences. The analysis aims to answer key business questions about restaurant types, customer ratings, and order behaviors using Python and its libraries.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib.pyplot**: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Library for statistical data visualization.

## Objectives

1. **Understand the Business Problems**:
   1. What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
   2. How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
   3. What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
   4. Zomato has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their average spending on each order?
   5. Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
   6. Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so Zomato can provide those customers with some good offers?

## Project Structure

1. **Uploading the Dataset and Importing Libraries**  
   *Time: 08:13 - 15:18*  
   Description: Uploading the dataset and importing necessary Python libraries.

2. **Data Cleaning & Data Preprocessing**  
   *Time: 15:19 - 24:45*  
   Description: Cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis, including handling missing values and converting data types.

3. **Question 1 Solution & Count Plot**  
   *Time: 24:46 - 25:48*  
   Description: Analyzed the type of restaurant that the majority of customers order from. Visualized the results using a count plot.

4. **Question 2 Solution & Line Graph**  
   *Time: 25:49 - 31:28*  
   Description: Determined the number of votes each type of restaurant received. Visualized the results using a line graph.

5. **Question 3 Solution & Histogram Plot**  
   *Time: 31:29 - 35:29*  
   Description: Analyzed the ratings that the majority of restaurants received. Visualized the results using a histogram plot.

6. **Question 4 Solution & Bar Graph**  
   *Time: 35:30 - 40:08*  
   Description: Evaluated the average spending on each order for couples who order online. Visualized the results using a bar graph.

7. **Question 5 Solution & Box Plot**  
   *Time: 40:09 - 42:53*  
   Description: Compared ratings based on the mode of ordering (online or offline). Visualized the results using a box plot.

8. **Question 6 Solution & Heatmap**  
   *Time: 45:54 - 48:40*  
   Description: Analyzed which type of restaurant received more offline orders. Visualized the results using a heatmap.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into customer preferences and restaurant performance on Zomato. The visualizations and findings can help Zomato make informed decisions to improve customer experience and tailor their offerings.
